# sound-identifier-app

A project I developed for my BSc thesis. Its aim is to identify sounds provided that they already exist in the database.

It consists of two parts: a mobile application which runs on the Android platform, and a web application written in Python (currently, only Python 2 is supported).

The backend is based on dejavu which can be found [here](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu/). Please read its README in order to get started.

The Android application needs the OpenCV SDK for Android. The latest version can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/). In order to work with the Android Studio, the folder (OpenCV-android-sdk) needs to be put in `..` of the project's directory.

If you have an issue, please post it on the Issues tab on GitHub.
